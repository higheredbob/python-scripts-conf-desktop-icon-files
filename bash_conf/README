Bash files, these are my active bash files. 
They will not work directly for the most 
part in your system, they are not standalone;
since they are attached to a plugin system,
or various other scripts not in this directory.

All scripts however, will be located in this repository, so if you
want the complete build I utilize, it will be here, but will require
some effort on your part to ensure they run on your system. 

My dev. environment, is a hybrid gentoo/funtoo build, so some things 
may not port directly over to your distrabution.
