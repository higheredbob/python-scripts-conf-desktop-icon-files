The files addto_bash_profile and urxtheme.plugin.bash require modification to work, 
the first needs to be added to your bash profile, or shell user-config.
While the second, needs to be added to either your plugin scripting system,
or sourced during sys init (openrc, systemd, etc). I guess you could just make it 
an exec in /usr/bin and run the command, but the whole point behind why I created it,
was to largely automate both the configuration of urxt and theming.

Also, DO NOT FORGET to change the pathing to the actual path you install the themes for urxt in.
If you so desire, you can also edit the urxtconfig file, to whatever settings you would like.
The settings used, are just my preferences. You will also notice, I prefer dark themes, and not one
light theme is utilized.
