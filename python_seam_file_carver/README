Python seam carving. This version can remove objects, and resize horizontally or vertically via seam carving.

It also allows the selction of three different algorhytms to parse images by.

The carver, does not allow for additional masks beyond the first one called to be applied incase
you get pinching or line runs. Best bet is to increase range step, or overall rendition decrease.

It would be easy to apply other masks, just add below the mask call any additional masks needed, 
there are plently in the same library used for the carver.
